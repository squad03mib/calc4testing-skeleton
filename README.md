### Setup the environment

To setup the environment, you should follow these steps:

1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. From IDE terminal, or normal Ubuntu/MacOS terminal execute the command `virtualenv venv` inside project root.
3. Now, you have to activate it, by executing the command `source venv/bin/activate`.
